# Wordle - by Andy Debenham

## Description

**Wordle** is a word guessing game where the user has 6 attempts to guess the unknown word. After each guess is submitted, the tiles change colour according to how close the guess was to the correct word.

* A *green* tile means the letter is in the word and is in the correct position
* A *yellow* tile means the letter is in the word but is not in the correct position
* A *grey* tile means the letter is not in the word

I chose wordle for my project because I enjoy this type of game. Similar to crosswords and other word-based puzzle games, wordle is a fun and challenging game that improves your vocabulary at the same time.
